# 🔢 BCD to Decimal Converter & Decimal Adder

A digital logic project implementing a BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) to Decimal Converter and Decimal Adder using 7447 and 2816 ICs. This hardware-based project demonstrates real-time numerical conversion and display on 7-segment displays, highlighting practical application of digital electronics and IC interfacing.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **BCD to Decimal Converter**: Converts 4-bit BCD input to decimal output using the 7447 BCD-to-7-segment decoder.
- **Decimal Adder**: Performs decimal addition and displays the result using multiple 7-segment displays.
- **Hardware-focused**: Built entirely using breadboard, wires, ICs, and displays — no microcontroller required.
- **Educational Value**: Great for learning binary systems, logic gates, and display interfacing.
